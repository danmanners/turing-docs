#### Not sure what opperating system you need?
Review some real world use cases and [get inspired](../use-cases/index.md "use case listing").

## Home Lab

Home Lab description here.

### Basic

A basic Home Lab setup with this [OS](https://docs.turingpi.com "link to OS installation instructions & Documentaiton") does these types of tasks very well.

### Moderate

A moderate Home Lab setup will do that and this using this [OS](https://docs.turingpi.com "link to OS installation instructions & Documentaiton") and these modifications.

### Advanced

An advanced Home Lab and a basic Native-Cloud set are very similar but using this [OS](https://docs.turingpi.com "link to OS installation instructions & Documentaiton") and [these modifications](https://docs.turingpi.com "link to this modification, installation instructions & Documentaiton") you will be lean and mean.

## Cloud-Native

Cloud-Native description here.

### Basic

A basic Cloud-Native system up for this and this tasks, we are going to need this [OS](https://docs.turingpi.com "link to OS installation instructions & Documentaiton"). 

### Moderate

If basic just won't do and you ready for some heavy lifting task or task. The [OS](https://docs.turingpi.com "link to OS installation instructions & Documentaiton") will need to be modified with [these additions](https://docs.turingpi.com "link to this addition, installation instructions & Documentaiton")
